              Conductor started as an idea back in 2019 to help with the
              transportation challenges in Lagos Nigeria. Challenges with
              passenger and driver route planning, passenger and driver identity
              and security and also route optimization. As a it personel the use
              of Google maps for route optimization and traffic avoidance was
              easy for me, but the challenge of sharing this knowledge with
              other commuters. Work on the app finally begun in January of 24,
              after details of financial sustainance of the app and company as a
              wholeÂ wasÂ ironedÂ out.
